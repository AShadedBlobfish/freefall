Version: Alpha 0.0.4
Release date: 01/02/2023
Changes:
	- Can't believe I used a version number for this - changed the default value for the height input box to 100m from 10m
Known issues:
	- Same as a-0.0.3
	

Version: Alpha 0.0.3
Release date: 01/02/2023
Changes:
	- Changed scale to 1 pixel = 1 metre
	- Changed the sample rate for the position of the falling object to 10Hz from 4Hz
Known issues:
	- The animated time is still greater than the simulated time (now only by a factor of ~1.1x), I am still looking into a fix but it seems likely that this is just due to processing time. (Numbers and mathematical simulation still remain correct)


Version: Alpha 0.0.2
Release date: 31/01/2023
Changes:
	- The falling is now more accurately animated
	- Changed scale to 10 pixels = 1 metre (might change again soon)
Known issues:
	- The animated time is greater than the simulated time by a factor of around 1.25x every time, I am looking into a fix. (Numbers and mathematical simulation remain correct)


Version: Alpha 0.0.1
Release date: 31/01/2023
