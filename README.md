# freefall
A project in which I attempt to simulate freefall motion in python.

Although I have a relatively good understanding of most aspects of python, I wanted to create a turtle-based physics simulation.
This seemed like an easy way to do it.

I might make more physics simulations in the future, but for now this is going to be what I spend my free time on.
