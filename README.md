# freefall
A project in which I attempt to simulate freefall motion in python.

Although I have a relatively good understanding of most aspects of python, the turtle is something I haven't made use of much. I wanted to create a turtle-based physics simulation and this seemed like an easy and fun one to make.

I might make more physics simulations in the future, but for now this is going to be what I spend my free time on.
